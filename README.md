## Donuts By Dennis!
Donuts by Dennis is a fun promotional site for a fake Donut shop in Canterbury; it provides the donut menu, the shop location, and the delivery information.

The website also has a donut gallery featuring the best selling donuts along with a description of the ingredients and any history that the donut recipe may have had.

The site is fully responsive with a flex box picture gallery and a hamburger style pop-out nav-bar.
